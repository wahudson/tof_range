		Design for Switched Capacitor TOF
		---------------------------------

Notes on design, as we proceede.

Acronyms:
    Time of Flight (TOF)
    Micro Channel Plate (MCP)
    Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
    Surface Mount Component (SMC)

Products:

    A)  Full function analog switch and capacitor.

    B)  Fixed capacitor (not switched).
	    For testing concept in best case conditions.

    C)  Feed thru device, no capacitor, no analog switch.
	    For testing insertion effects of device.

    D)  Analog switch with only DC control.

    E)  Analog switch with level translator.

    F)  Add power supply.

    G)  Add digital delay control.


Situation:

    The TOF MCP detector has an N-Type Jack with Female socket.  Very rugged,
    built into the vacuum flange.  Cannot be changed.

    The mating cable has an N-Type Plug with Male pin (floating threaded
    collar to tighten the connection).
    Looks like RG-58 cable, 50 ohm.
    Could replace with another connector and cable.

    Pulse edge rate is around 2 V/ns.
    Pulse height around 5 V, into 50 ohm termination is 100 mA current.
    Digitizer bandwidth is 500 MHz, with 1 GSPS (Giga Sample Per Second).

    This is very fast edge rates, requiring careful physical design of signal
    and ground current paths.  Need to control parasitic inductance and
    capacitance.  Also 100 mA is pretty high current for most
    fast analog switches.

    The MCP is a charge source.
    We are primarily interested in integrating the total charge in each
    peak of the spectrum.  As such, distortion of the peak shape is acceptable,
    as long as the charge is conserved and individual peaks do not overlap.
    After all, the principle of the switched-capacitor is to lower and broaden
    the peaks.
    However, with the capacitor off, we would like to have good peak fidelity.
    This may help relax physical layout constraints.

    Signal Polarity:  Is negative (0 V to -5 V or more).
    This is because electrons land on the MCP anode.

    Control signal:  From external time delay control.
    ??? What logic levels?
    ??? Probably single-ended (not differential).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## High-level Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best vision:  (2019-03-11)

    N-Type connectors adapt to SMA connectors on PCB.

    Capacitor is switched to +5 V, which is also an AC ground.
    Analog switch operates above ground.
    Thus on the analog switch, NO signal is +5 V, and a -5 V pulse is 0 V.

    Analog input protection:  The MCP can deliver arbitrary large signal
    voltages.  Must operate to keep voltages within absolute maximums.
    Normal signal levels may exceed -10 V in pulse height.
    May want clamp diodes to help protect analog switch, which may be
    only 5 V tolerant.

    Control signals all single-ended, and we accept slower edge rates and
    longer propagation delays.
    Avoid differential signaling and associated complexity.

    Power supplies probably +5 V.
    Possibly on board LDO (Low Drop-Out voltage) regulators.


Alternative Direct implementation:  (is more complex)
    Capacitor switched to Ground.  Analog switch must operate below ground
    because the input signal is negative.

    Analog switch passes 0 V to -5 V analog signals.
    Operates from a negative power supply.
    Control signals are negative voltage (below ground).

    Level translator/isolator converts positive control input to negative
    voltage for the analog switch.
    Possibly additional buffer or signal conditioner will be needed.

    Power supplies probably +5 V and -5 V.
    Possibly on board LDO regulators.

    All this complexity is avoided with the Capacitor to +5 V above.

Idea:
    Capacitor need not connect to ground.  Think AC coupled, and allow
    analog switch to operate above ground.
    Is this possible?  Yes!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Connector Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connector types:
    We consider only these types, as they are commonly available in a wide
    range of configurations.

 >  A) N-Type (MCP output)
 >  B) SMA
    C) BNC

    In adapters, there are a lot more N-Type to SMA, than N-type to BNC.
    BNC adapters typically go to 4 GHz, while SMA go to 11 GHz.
    SMA is smaller than BNC, and a lot more interface to PCB.

    ==> Use SMA connectors on PCB, and adapters to N-Type.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fixed capacitor (not switched) Procuct (B)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
    Proof of concept.
    Measure MCP effective capacitance.
    Does adding capacitance produce the desired effect?

    Somehow add a 100 pF capacitor in-parallel to the N-Type connectors.

Design:
    Avoid the need to make a PCB.  We want to first see if the idea even has
    a chance of working.

    Use an SMA T-connector F-M-F, with the Female ends connecting to N-type
    adapters on the MCP and Digitizer cable.

    Use SMA board edge connectors (Jack, Female socket) with capacitor
    soldered between the pin and ground lug.  This is then easily connected
    to the Male T port.  Make several with different capacitor values.
    Can change capacitors without powering-down, since the Digitizer is
    always connected to the MCP thru the T-connector.

    Place first parts order to implement at least this.

    Another idea:
    Use two SMA PCB connectors soldered back-to-back.  Add capacitor between
    center conductor and grounding prongs.  This is very in-line, but is
    harder to make.

Detail Design:

    These 3 connector fittings are in-line from MCP to Digitizer, and provide
    an SMA Male port on which to attach capacitors.

	Adapter, N Male to SMA Male, Straight, (Amphenol 242114)

	SMA T-shape F-M-F, (Amphenol 132217)

	Adapter, SMA Male to N Female, Straight (Amphenol 242112)

    An SMA right angle connector is added on the output to Digitizer, since
    there is not enough room (only 4 inchs) for everything to stack in a
    straight line:

	SMA Right angle M-F (Amphenol 132172)

    Capacitors, SMC (Surface Mount Component) type, are mounted on the
    center pin and ground lugs of this SMA Jack.
    A size 1210 SMC is 0.126 inch long, which is just right to span the
    connector, which is 0.125 inch from center line of center pin to outer
    edge of the ground lug.

	SMA Jack, Female Socket, Board edge launch, 0.250 inch Wide
	    (RF Solutions CON-SMA-EDGE-S)

    Capacitors are choosen in size 1210 SMC package.  Choose C0G dielectric,
    which has the best stability.  This is a fairly large package for the
    capacitance value, so they tend to have higher voltage ratings, which is
    fine.  These are standard values, which are in a logarithmic progression,
    which is what we want to see effect.  Mica capacitors were also considered,
    and are also very stable, but cost more and did not seem to have any
    significant advantage for our purpose.

    Capacitors, High Voltage, Ceramic C0G Dielectric:

	Kemet C1206C220JBGAC7800   22 pF,  630V, SMC 1206  5%
	Kemet C1210C470JDGAC7800   47 pF, 1000V, SMC 1210  5%
	Kemet C1210C101GCGAC7800  100 pF,  500V, SMC 1210  2%
	Kemet C1210C221JDGAC7800  220 pF, 1000V, SMC 1210  5%
	Kemet C1210C471JDGACTU    470 pF, 1000V, SMC 1210  5%

    Now everything simply screws together, no PCB needed.

Experiment:

    Connect SMA T-connector at the MCP and in-line to the Digitizer using
    the N-Type adapter fittings.  This requires MCP power-down, and caution
    to discharge any high-voltage on the MCP anode.

    Operate the TOF system as normal, with nothing attached to the SMA T port.

    The idea is to try a range of capacitor values from 22 pF to 470 pF.
    The 22 pF represents the minimum expected load capacitance on the
    final product with switch OFF.
    The high-end capacitance is to see what too much looks like.

    Take multiple shots (spectra) with each capacitor value.  Possibly in
    conditions that make averaging the spectra meaningful.

    The sample should be something that shows representative small and large
    peaks, and is very repeatable.  We are trying to test the electronic
    system, not the sample.

    The capacitance of the MCP can be estimated by measuring the change
    in voltage of a large peak when a known capacitance is added.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analog switch with only DC control.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
    Prove out analog switch connecting capacitor to MCP output.
    No dynamic switching needed, just hold switch ON or OFF.
    Switch OFF - look for parasitic capacitance perturbing the small peak.
    Switch ON - look to see that intended capacitance is effective in
    spreading the large peak.

    Typical analog switches seem far from ideal for our situation.
    OFF capacitance is 10 to 20 pF.
    ON resistance often > 1 ohm.
    Bandwidth around 300 MHz, may impede capacitor charging.
    Switching time is not important for this test, possibly even try
    really slow ones, e.g. 1 us switching time, to get other parameters
    better.

Design:
    A PCB is required.

    Try multiple analog switches, which typically have different footprints,
    requiring different PCB layouts.

    Possibly put two or three switches on one board, and populate only one,
    as a way to reduce the number of different PCBs.

    Possibly layout one board as multiple channels, each with a different
    analog switch.

    Probably allow attachement of a digital control signal.  Just don't
    delay schedule solving the fast digital control problem.
