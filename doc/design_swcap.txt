		Design for Switched Capacitor TOF
		---------------------------------

Notes on design, as we proceede.

Acronyms:
    Time of Flight (TOF)
    Micro Channel Plate (MCP)
    Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

Products:

    A)  Full function analog switch and capacitor.

    B)  Fixed capacitor (not switched).
	    For testing concept in best case conditions.

    C)  Feed thru device, no capacitor, no analog switch.
	    For testing insertion effects of device.

    D)  Back-to-back Type-N flange connectors.
	    See if flange bolts provide adaquate ground path.

    E)  Analog switch with only DC control.

    F)  Analog switch with level translator.

    G)  Add power supply.

    H)  Add digital delay control.


Situation:

    The TOF MCP detector has an N-Type Jack with Female socket.  Very rugged,
    built into the vacuum flange.  Cannot be changed.

    The mating cable has an N-Type Plug with Male pin (floating threaded
    collar to tighten the connection).
    Looks like RG-58 cable, 50 ohm.
    Could replace with another connector and cable.

    Pulse edge rate is around 2 V/ns.
    Pulse height around 5 V, into 50 ohm termination is 100 mA current.
    Digitizer bandwidth is 500 MHz, with 1 GSPS (Giga Sample Per Second).

    This is very fast edge rates, requiring careful physical design of signal
    and ground current paths.  Need to control parasitic inductance and
    capacitance.  Also 100 mA is pretty high current for most
    fast analog switches.

    The MCP is a charge source.
    We are primarily interested in integrating the total charge in each
    peak of the spectrum.  As such, distortion of the peak shape is acceptable,
    as long as the charge is conserved and individual peaks do not overlap.
    After all, the principle of the switched-capacitor is to lower and broaden
    the peaks.
    However, with the capacitor off, we would like to have good peak fidelity.
    This may help relax physical layout constraints.

    Signal Polarity:  Is negative (0 V to -5 V or more).
    This is because electrons land on the MCP anode.

    Control signal:  From external time delay control.
    ??? What logic levels?
    ??? Probably single-ended (not differential).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## High-level Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best vision:  (2019-03-11)

    N-Type connectors adapt to SMA connectors on PCB.

    Capacitor switched to +5 V, which is also an AC ground.
    Analog switch operates above ground.
    Thus on the analog switch, NO signal is +5 V, and a -5 V pulse is 0 V.

    Analog input protection:  The MCP can deliver arbitrary large signal
    voltages.  Must operate to keep voltages within absolute maximums.
    Normal signal levels may exceed -10 V in pulse height.
    May want clamp diodes to help protect analog switch, which may be
    only 5 V tolerant.

    Control signals all single-ended, and we accept slower edge rates and
    longer propagation delays.
    Avoid differential signaling and associated complexity.

    Power supplies probably +5 V.
    Possibly on board LDO (Low Drop-Out voltage) regulators.


Alternative Direct implementation:  (is more complex)
    Capacitor switched to Ground.  Analog switch must operate below ground
    because the input signal is negative.

    Analog switch passes 0 V to -5 V analog signals.
    Operates from a negative power supply.
    Control signals are negative voltage (below ground).

    Level translator/isolator converts positive control input to negative
    voltage for the analog switch.
    Possibly additional buffer or signal conditioner will be needed.

    Power supplies probably +5 V and -5 V.
    Possibly on board LDO regulators.

    All this complexity is avoided with the Capacitor to +5 V above.

Idea:
    Capacitor need not connect to ground.  Think AC coupled, and allow
    analog switch to operate above ground.
    Is this possible?  Yes!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Connector Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connector types:
    We consider only these types, as they are commonly available in a wide
    range of configurations.

 >  A) N-Type (MCP output)
 >  B) SMA
    C) BNC

    In adapters, there are a lot more N-Type to SMA, than N-type to BNC.
    BNC adapters typically go to 4 GHz, while SMA go to 11 GHz.
    SMA is smaller than BNC, and a lot more interface to PCB.

    ==> Use SMA connectors on PCB, and adapters to N-Type.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fixed capacitor (not switched) Procuct (B)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
    Proof of concept.
    Does adding capacitance produce the desired effect?
    Measure MCP effective capacitance.

    Somehow add a 100 pF capacitor in-parallel to the N-Type connectors.

Design:
    Avoid the need to make a PCB.  We want to first see if the idea even has a
    chance of working.

    Use an SMA T-connector F-M-F, with the Male connecting to an N-type
    adapter on the MCP.

    Use SMA board edge connectors (Jack, Female socket) with capacitor
    soldered between the pin and ground lug.  This is then easily connected
    to the Male T port.  Make several with different capacitor values.

    Place first parts order to implement at least this.

    Another idea:
    Use two SMA PCB connectors soldered back-to-back.  Add capacitor between
    center conductor and grounding prongs.
    This is very in-line, but is harder to make.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analog switch with only DC control.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
    Prove out analog switch connecting capacitor to MCP output.
    No dynamic switching needed, just hold switch ON or OFF.
    Switch OFF - look for parasitic capacitance perturbing the small peak.
    Switch ON - look to see that intended capacitance is effective in
    spreading the large peak.

    Typical analog switches seem far from ideal for our situation.
    OFF capacitance is 10 to 20 pF.
    ON resistance often > 1 ohm.
    Bandwidth around 300 MHz, may impede capacitor charging.
    Switching time is not important for this test, possibly even try
    really slow ones, e.g. 1 us switching time, to get other parameters
    better.

Design:
    A PCB is required.

    Try multiple analog switches, which typically have different footprints,
    requiring different PCB layouts.

    Possibly put two or three switches on one board, and populate only one,
    as a way to reduce the number of different PCBs.

    Possibly layout one board as multiple channels, each with a different
    analog switch.

    Probably allow attachement of a digital control signal.  Just don't
    delay schedule solving the fast digital control problem.
